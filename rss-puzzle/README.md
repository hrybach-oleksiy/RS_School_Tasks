# Pull Request -  Create Mandatory Input Fields for First Name and Surname on Login Page (feat: RSS-PZ-01)

1. **Designing Input Fields:**

   - Two input fields are placed on the login page, distinctly labeled as 'First Name' and 'Surname'.
   - The fields are placed in a logical order, typically with the first name field above the surname field.

2. **Mandatory Fields:**

   - Both input fields are required. The form cannot be submitted unless both fields contain data.

3. **Login Button:**

   - 'Login' button is introduced below the surname field.
   - The button initially is in a default state, becoming fully interactive once the form requirements are met.

4. **Styling and Layout:**
   - The input fields and 'Login' button are clearly visible and accessible.
   - Clean and minimal design is used to avoid user distraction or confusion.
