## Transcript of the Presentation

Hello everyone! My name is Oleksiy, and I'm from Kyiv.  
 
I graduated from Kyiv University of Tourism, Economics, and Law with a degree in tourism management.  
 
Right now, I'm learning Frontend and everything related to it. Back in 2008, when it wasn't mainstream yet, I started learning HTML. I enjoyed it a lot, but I chose another way - working in tourism as a tourism manager.  

In 2020, the COVID pandemic took away my beloved job in tourism, leading me to reconsider if there could be another job I'd love. I remembered my youth and returned to HTML. And where HTML is, there's JavaScript. Despite some people joking about it and not liking this programming language, I enjoy it. I appreciate its versatility, syntax, and the fact that you can see the results of your work immediately.  
 
I found joy in it again, and there's hope that I might find another job I love. Of course, I have a long way to go, and learning JavaScript isn't easy for me, but I'm not giving up and making progress step by step.
I enjoy learning and gaining new knowledge, which is why I'm currently exploring a new field for myself - programming.  

I've completed several Frontend courses, including two courses by Epam. Additionally I've taken the 0 Stage at Rs School twice, and this is my second time in Stage 1. I hope this time I'll finish it and gain the necessary knowledge to apply for a developer position. Learning at Rs School is probably the most interesting experience I've had in my learning. There's a large community, interesting assignments, and the opportunity to learn from more experienced students. I hope this time I'll get to learn something new and useful from my mentor as well.  

I don't have many pet projects, mostly those I did while studying at Rs School, but I also completed a small pizza shop project. There, I used React, TypeScript, and Redux Toolkit. It wasn't easy; I had to learn and understand a lot of new things, but I've gone through it and can say that at least I have a foundation for further development.  
 
As for what's next, I plan to dive into Next.js, learn about some  databases, and brush up on some backend language to understand how things work there. That's briefly my plans for the future.  

I wish everyone to complete this course and achieve everything they came here for. Good luck!
